# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```
  We can achieve the same functionality with a `for` loop, without using the `break` statement, by having the limit of i less than or equal to 7.
