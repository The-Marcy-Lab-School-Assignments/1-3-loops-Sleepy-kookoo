# Question
In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer
    A  `while` is better when you want a statement to be executed as long as the specific condition is true. 
    A `for` loop can contain three optional condition and is usually more of a block statement. 

# Teacher Feedback

You are really close! You understood while loops really well! However a for loop does not have optional conditions! There are 3 parts to a for loop and each one is needed for the loop to run.
